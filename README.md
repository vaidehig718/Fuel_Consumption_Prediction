# Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emissions Analysis
# Project Description
This project analyzes vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions data to identify patterns and build predictive models. The goal is to understand how features like engine size, vehicle class, and transmission type impact fuel consumption and emissions.

# Problem Definition
# Background
Reducing CO2 emissions from vehicles is crucial for environmental protection. Fuel consumption is directly linked to CO2 emissions, making it essential to analyze and optimize fuel usage.

# Objectives
Analyze the relationship between vehicle features and fuel consumption/CO2 emissions.
Build predictive models to forecast fuel consumption based on vehicle attributes.
Provide visualizations and insights for better data understanding.

# Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis
# Data Source
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information on year, make, model, vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, fuel type, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions.

# Data Overview
Initial data inspection involved checking for null values, data types, and calculating descriptive statistics. A correlation matrix was created to identify relationships between numerical features.

# Model Building
# Linear Regression Model
A linear regression model was built to predict fuel consumption based on engine size and other relevant features. Model performance was evaluated using the R-squared score.

# Train-Test Split and Model Evaluation
The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The model's accuracy was measured using the R-squared score on both sets.

# Ridge Regression Model
A Ridge regression model, including regularization to prevent overfitting, was implemented and evaluated.
